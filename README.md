Welcome to the Recipe Search Application! This web application allows users to search and explore a variety of recipes from around the world. The app is built using Next.js and TypeScript and fetches data from the TheMealDB API to provide detailed information on meals, including ingredients, preparation instructions, and related images. The app features a modern and responsive design, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

Implement loading indicators to inform users when data is being fetched or loaded, improving the app's interactivity.
can use tanstack Library for data fetching and mutation
Enhanced Search Functionality:
Implement features like debouncing for search input to reduce unnecessary API calls.
Dark Mode:
Implement a dark mode toggle to enhance user accessibility and provide a better viewing experience at night.
Accessibility Improvements:
Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA attributes, improving keyboard navigation, and ensuring proper color contrast.
