Welcome to the Recipe Search Application! This web application allows users to search and explore a variety of recipes from around the world. The app is built using Next.js and TypeScript and fetches data from the TheMealDB API to provide detailed information on meals, including ingredients, preparation instructions, and related images. The app features a modern and responsive design, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
